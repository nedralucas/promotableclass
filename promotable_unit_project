/*
Problem/Hypothesis
There are about 500 traditional schools in the Chicago Public School District.
As of SY 2016, 17.8% of principals left either their current schools or the District all together.
Principal turnover has been linked to fragmented student achievement.
I believe that if a principal is retained for a second contract (after 5 years)
at the same school should provide consistency.

Hypothesis/ Problem Solution
Try to retain principals for at least 5 years at the same school to provide consistency for all school stakeholders.

Hypothesis Result
From the query, a majority of schools with principals that have been at the school over 4.9 years a higher SQRP rating.

If I had more time, I would do an analysis of SQRP over time.
